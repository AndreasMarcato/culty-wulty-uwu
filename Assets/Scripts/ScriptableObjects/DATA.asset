  personSadDialogueOnInteractData:
  - Fair day traveler. I am sorry if I seem down, but my closest friend and dearest
    drinking partner hath left this world. I do not know what to do with myself.
  - Alas, kind stranger, could thou help me a bit. I need someone to talk to for
    my dearest wife hath passed away recently.
  - 'Sad day, kind stranger. My workshop recently burned down. No longer can I support
    myself, let alone my 3 children and wife. '
  - Alas, kind stranger, could thou help me a bit. I need someone to talk to for
    my dearest husband hath passed away recently.
  - Sad day, kind stranger. My workshop recently burned down. No longer can I support
    myself, let alone my 3 children and husband.
  - "Alas, Good soul. My youngest hath come down with miasma and the witch\u2019s
    herbs are not helping like they first did. Worried sick, I am that my youngest
    shall not see the winter."
  - "Greetings, stranger. It\u2019s been tough times. The harvest was taken by the
    miasma and now the whole town\u2019s stomachs are growling. What doth thou reckon
    we do?"
  - 'I miss my wife. '
  - 'I miss my mother. '
  - I miss my father.
  - 'I miss my husband. '
  personSadDialogueResponseYesData:
  - Perhaps some new friends could help lighten the can recent events.
  personSadDialogueResponseNoData:
  - Wait a moment now. Joining a group of friends sounded like a fine idea, but if
    there be any talk of cultish business, I'm not joining for I've got enough burdens
    to bear without adding mysterious gatherings to the mix.
  personNeutralDialogueOnInteractData:
  - Hark, stranger. A plague lurks in the walls around us. How dos   thou cope when
    death looms over us?
  - Salutations, kind stranger. How dost thou manage in these hungry days?
  - "Hail, kind stranger. Have thou heard the news that the church doesn\u2019t have
    a connection with God. The word is they worship an idol and have been lead stray.
    What are your thoughts friend?"
  - "Hail, neighbor. The tax collector\u2019s shadow is looming above us and my bag
    has nothing but crumbs. How do thou fair under this heavy burden?"
  - Greetings. Has thou heard? The neighboring town hath been stuck by illness. What
    shall we do when the wind brings the putrid miasma filled air to us? Will we
    all finally die?
  - ' Salutations dear friend. Excuse my sadness but my children have     left me
    and moved to faraway lands. I miss them dearly. '
  personNeutralDialogueResponseYesData:
  - ' Well, now, that''s a pleasant turn of events. I reckon I wouldn''t mind joining
    a group of friends for a chat by a drink. A bit of camaraderie might sprinkle
    some warmth into these grey days of mine. '
  - ' Hold on just a moment. Are we talking about a friendly gathering, or is there
    more to this fellowship than meets the eye? I''ve got no want for getting tangled
    up in any sort of peculiar business.  '

  - "By the heavens above! A miracle unfolds before mine eyes. The hand of the Almighty
    is evident in thy deeds, and I stand in awe. Surely, this manifestation of divine
    power is a sign\u2014a sign that the path thou treadest, though unconventional,
    may hold the favor of the divine. I shall reflect upon this extraordinary occurrence
    and seek guidance from the Almighty."
  personBossDialogueResponseNoData:
  - By the heavens, thou speakest madness! To stray into the arms of false gods is
    to invite damnation upon thy soul. The righteous anger of the Almighty burns
    within me. Repent, lest the flames of divine fury consume thee and thy misguided
    allegiance!"
