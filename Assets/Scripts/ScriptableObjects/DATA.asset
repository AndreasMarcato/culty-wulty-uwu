  personSadDialogueOnInteractData:
  - Fair day traveler. I am sorry if I seem down, but my closest friend and dearest
    drinking partner hath left this world. I do not know what to do with myself.
  - Alas, kind stranger, could thou help me a bit. I need someone to talk to for
    my dearest wife hath passed away recently.
  - Alas, kind stranger, could thou help me a bit. I need someone to talk to for
    my dearest husband hath passed away recently.
  - Sad day, kind stranger. My workshop recently burned down. No longer can I support
    myself, let alone my 3 children and husband.
  - "Alas, Good soul. My youngest hath come down with miasma and the witch\u2019s
    herbs are not helping like they first did. Worried sick, I am that my youngest
    shall not see the winter."
  - "Greetings, stranger. It\u2019s been tough times. The harvest was taken by the
    miasma and now the whole town\u2019s stomachs are growling. What doth thou reckon
    we do?"
  - 'I miss my wife. '
  - 'I miss my mother. '
  - I miss my father.
  - 'I miss my husband. '
  personSadDialogueResponseYesData:
  - Perhaps some new friends could help lighten these recent events.
  - A miracle! Perhaps god hath chosen thou as the true leader.
  personSadDialogueResponseNoData:
  - Wait a moment now. Joining a group of friends sounded like a fine idea, but if
    there be any talk of cultish business, I'm not joining for I've got enough burdens
    to bear without adding mysterious gatherings to the mix.
  - Witchcraft, take thy magic away from here. I have enough trouble on my own
  personNeutralDialogueOnInteractData:
  - Hark, stranger. A plague lurks in the walls around us. How dos thou cope when
    death looms over us?
  - Salutations, kind stranger. How dost thou manage in these hungry days?
  - "Hail, kind stranger. Have thou heard the news that the church doesn\u2019t have
    a connection with God. The word is they worship an idol and have been lead stray.
    What are your thoughts friend?"
  - "Hail, neighbor. The tax collector\u2019s shadow is looming above us and my bag
    has nothing but crumbs. How do thou fair under this heavy burden?"
  - Greetings. Has thou heard? The neighboring town hath been stuck by illness. What
    shall we do when the wind brings the putrid miasma filled air to us? Will we
    all finally die?
  - 'Salutations dear friend. Excuse my sadness but my children have left me and
    moved to faraway lands. I miss them dearly. '
  personNeutralDialogueResponseYesData:
  - 'Well, now, that''s a pleasant turn of events. I reckon I wouldn''t mind joining
    a group of friends for a chat by a drink. A bit of camaraderie might sprinkle
    some warmth into these grey days of mine. '
  - A miracle! Perhaps god hath chosen thou as the true leader.
  personNeutralDialogueResponseNoData:
  - ' Hold on just a moment. Are we talking about a friendly gathering, or is there
    more to this fellowship than meets the eye? I''ve got no want for getting tangled
    up in any sort of peculiar business.  '
  - Witchcraft, take thy magic away from here. I have enough trouble on my own
  personBossDialogueOnInteractData:
  - Greetings child, How does the lord shine upon thee in these troubled times?
  personBossDialogueResponseYesData:
  - "By the heavens above! A miracle unfolds before mine eyes. The hand of the Almighty
    is evident in thy deeds, and I stand in awe. Surely, this manifestation of divine
    power is a sign\u2014a sign that the path thou treadest, though unconventional,
    may hold the favor of the divine. I shall reflect upon this extraordinary occurrence
    and seek guidance from the Almighty."
  personBossDialogueResponseNoData:
  - By the heavens, thou are taken over by madness! To stray into the arms of false
    gods is to invite damnation upon thy soul. The righteous anger of the Almighty
    burns within me. Repent, lest the flames of divine fury consume thee and thy
    misguided allegiance!"

  playerSadResponse:
  - Condolences dear friend. Losing a life can be tough times. Perhaps joining our
    comradeship would help thou fill the emptiness thou may feel.

    thou trust me.

    harvest for those who worship the true one.
  - Thou are correct my friend. I have spoken with the true God and he showed me
    the heathenous acts the false church commits. Join me so I may lead thou to the
    right path.
  - These tough times are best with a fellowship. With love from our savior and from
    each other, tough times mean nothing to us.
  - I have spoken with God and their word states anyone who follows the True One
    shall be spared from the plague.
  - Our crew hath a fair few who have gone through the same as thou has. If thou
    mood is low, stop by and have a drink on us.
  playerBossResponse:
  - You follow false gods. Your words poison the townsfolk and the air with your
    false faith
  - You god is a fruad. You follow nothing beyond the stench of gold. Turn to me
    if you want to be redeemed
  - Your words spread miasma throughout the lands. Your heathenous god strays the
    people from the true path
  playerMagicResponse:
  - '*You perform a small trick with cards*'
  - '*You use some slight of hand to pull a Disaronno from behind their ears*'
  - '*You pull a seemingly endless number of handkerchiefs from you mouth*'

    dead\u201D *"
  - '*You channel the power of your god and perform a true miracle, the symbol of
    you God appears in their mind*'
